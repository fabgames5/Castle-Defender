Thank you for downloading my module!

Feel free to delete the demo folder once you've got the grasp of how things work :)
Just keep the csHomebrewIK script and editorHomebrewIK script intact.

Plus, as a small tip, Smooth Time property will give a small delay to the foot positioning process,
which may cause the foot go underground even with height correction on.
The calculation will work just the same, but there will be a smoothing applied based on the property.
In this case, you may have to choose between visual quality and accuracy.

Well then, thank you again, and have a great time!
